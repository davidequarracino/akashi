# Configuration Reference

All configuration is via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for a minimal starting point.

## Required

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | PostgreSQL connection string for queries and writes |
| `AKASHI_ADMIN_API_KEY` | — | Bootstrap API key for the admin agent. Required when the agents table is empty |

## Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `AKASHI_READ_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | HTTP read timeout |
| `AKASHI_WRITE_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | HTTP write timeout |
| `AKASHI_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` | `1048576` | Max request body size (1 MB) |
| `AKASHI_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `AKASHI_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins. Empty = deny cross-origin browser requests unless same-origin |

## Database

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | PostgreSQL connection string for queries and writes. In production, point this at PgBouncer; in local dev, point directly at Postgres (port 5432) |
| `NOTIFY_URL` | same as `DATABASE_URL` | Direct Postgres connection for LISTEN/NOTIFY (SSE). Must bypass PgBouncer — transaction-mode poolers do not support LISTEN. Set `NOTIFY_URL=` to disable SSE push entirely |
| `AKASHI_SKIP_EMBEDDED_MIGRATIONS` | `false` | Skip startup embedded migrations (use when an external system like Atlas owns migration execution) |

See [ADR-007](../adrs/ADR-007-dual-postgres-connections.md) for why two connections are needed.

## Authentication

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_ADMIN_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Bootstrap admin API key. If no agents exist and this is empty, startup fails to prevent admin lockout |
| `AKASHI_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Path to Ed25519 private key PEM file. **Empty = ephemeral key generated on every startup** — all tokens are invalidated on each restart. Use persistent keys for any real use. |
| `AKASHI_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Path to Ed25519 public key PEM file (must be set alongside the private key) |
| `AKASHI_JWT_EXPIRATION` | `24h` | JWT token lifetime |
| `AKASHI_SIGNUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable unauthenticated `POST /auth/signup` for self-serve org creation. Keep `false` for self-hosted; set `true` for cloud deployments |

Both key files must have `0600` permissions. The server rejects looser modes at startup.

**Generating persistent keys** (run once from the repo root):

```bash
go run scripts/genkey/main.go
# Writes: data/jwt_private.pem, data/jwt_public.pem
```

The `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./data` as `/data` in the container and sets the key paths to `/data/jwt_private.pem` and `/data/jwt_public.pem` by default, so the keys survive container rebuilds automatically.

See [ADR-005](../adrs/ADR-005-auth-rbac.md) for the full auth architecture.

For `Authorization: ApiKey <agent_id>:<api_key>`, send `X-Akashi-Org-ID` when the same `agent_id` exists in multiple organizations. Ambiguous API key auth requests are rejected.

## Embeddings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `auto` | Provider selection: `auto`, `ollama`, `openai`, `noop` |
| `AKASHI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `1024` | Vector dimensionality (must match the chosen model) |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server address |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `mxbai-embed-large` | Ollama embedding model |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | OpenAI API key. Required when provider is `openai` |
| `AKASHI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | OpenAI embedding model |

In `auto` mode: Ollama is tried first (health check with 2s timeout), then OpenAI if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, then noop (zero vectors, semantic search disabled). See [ADR-006](../adrs/ADR-006-embedding-provider-chain.md).

## Vector Search (Qdrant)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `QDRANT_URL` | _(empty)_ | Qdrant URL. `:6334` (gRPC) is preferred; `:6333` (REST) is accepted and auto-mapped to `:6334`. Empty = text search fallback |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Qdrant API key |
| `QDRANT_COLLECTION` | `akashi_decisions` | Qdrant collection name |
| `AKASHI_OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL` | `1s` | How often the outbox worker checks for pending syncs |
| `AKASHI_OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | Max decisions synced to Qdrant per poll cycle |

Qdrant is optional. When not configured, search falls back to PostgreSQL full-text search (tsvector/tsquery) with ILIKE as secondary fallback. See [ADR-002](../adrs/ADR-002-unified-postgres-storage.md).

## Rate Limiting

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable rate limiting middleware |
| `AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_RPS` | `100` | Sustained requests per second per key |
| `AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | `200` | Token bucket capacity (max burst size) per key |
| `AKASHI_TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | When true, use X-Forwarded-For for IP-based rate limits (e.g. behind load balancer) |

Keys are constructed as `org:<uuid>:agent:<id>` for authenticated requests. For unauthenticated paths (e.g. `/auth/token`), the key is `ip:<client_ip>`. Enable `AKASHI_TRUST_PROXY` only when behind a trusted reverse proxy; otherwise X-Forwarded-For can be spoofed.

The OSS distribution uses an in-memory token bucket. Enterprise deployments can substitute a Redis-backed implementation via the `ratelimit.Limiter` interface.

## Observability (OpenTelemetry)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | _(empty)_ | OTLP HTTP endpoint. Empty = OTEL disabled |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` | `false` | Use HTTP instead of HTTPS for OTLP |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `akashi` | Service name in OTEL spans and metrics |

## Conflict Detection

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CANDIDATE_LIMIT` | `20` | Max candidates retrieved from Qdrant per decision. Lower values reduce LLM cost; higher values improve recall for embedding-only scoring |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_SIGNIFICANCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.30` | Min significance (topic_sim × outcome_div) to store a conflict |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_EARLY_EXIT_FLOOR` | `0.25` | Min pre-LLM significance for early exit pruning. Candidates are sorted by significance descending; once significance drops below this floor (and the candidate doesn't qualify for the bi-encoder bypass), remaining candidates are skipped. Set to `0` to disable early exit |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CLAIM_TOPIC_SIM_FLOOR` | `0.60` | Min cosine similarity for two claims to be considered "about the same thing." Below this, claims are too unrelated to constitute a conflict |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CLAIM_DIV_FLOOR` | `0.15` | Min outcome divergence between two claims to count as a genuine disagreement. Below this, claims effectively agree |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_DECISION_TOPIC_SIM_FLOOR` | `0.70` | Min decision-level topic similarity to activate claim-level scoring. Below this, decisions are about different enough topics that claim analysis adds noise |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `30s` | Interval for broker to poll new conflicts (SSE push). Conflicts are populated event-driven on trace. |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_LLM_MODEL` | _(empty)_ | LLM model for conflict validation. Set to an Ollama model name (e.g. `qwen3.5:9b`) to use local validation, or leave empty to auto-detect (OpenAI if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise noop). |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_LLM_THREADS` | `floor(NumCPU/3)`, min 1 | CPU threads Ollama may use per inference call. Caps Ollama thread usage so conflict validation does not starve the main request-handling goroutines. Set to `0` to let Ollama decide (uses all available cores). |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_BACKFILL_WORKERS` | `4` | Number of parallel workers for conflict backfill scoring on startup. Each worker makes one LLM validation call at a time. |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_DECAY_LAMBDA` | `0.01` | Temporal decay rate for conflict significance. Higher values penalize older decision pairs more aggressively. Set to `0` to disable temporal decay. |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CROSS_ENCODER_URL` | _(empty)_ | URL of an external cross-encoder reranking service. When set, candidate pairs are scored for contradiction likelihood before LLM validation; pairs below `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CROSS_ENCODER_THRESHOLD` are filtered out, reducing LLM calls by 50-80%. The service must expose `POST /score` accepting `{"text_a": "...", "text_b": "..."}` and returning `{"score": 0.0-1.0}`. Empty = disabled |
| `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CROSS_ENCODER_THRESHOLD` | `0.50` | Minimum cross-encoder contradiction score (0-1) for a candidate pair to proceed to LLM validation. Lower values pass more pairs (higher recall, more LLM cost). Higher values filter more aggressively (lower recall, fewer LLM calls). Only effective when `AKASHI_CONFLICT_CROSS_ENCODER_URL` is set |
| `AKASHI_CLAIM_EXTRACTION_LLM` | `false` | Use the conflict LLM model for structured claim extraction. When enabled, claims are extracted with categories (finding, recommendation, assessment, status) and only findings and assessments participate in conflict scoring. Requires `AKASHI_CONFLICT_LLM_MODEL` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set; falls back to regex extraction if LLM is unavailable. |
| `AKASHI_FORCE_CONFLICT_RESCORE` | `false` | When `true` (and an LLM validator is configured), clear all existing conflicts and re-score from scratch at startup. Use after improving the LLM prompt or claim extraction logic. One-shot flag — disable after the rescore completes. |

## Event WAL (Write-Ahead Log)

The WAL is **enabled by default** to ensure crash durability for buffered events. Without it, a process crash between flush intervals loses all in-memory events.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_WAL_DIR` | `./data/wal` | Directory for WAL segment files. Created automatically on startup if it doesn't exist. Override to place WAL on a faster disk (e.g. `/var/lib/akashi/wal`) |
| `AKASHI_WAL_DISABLE` | `false` | Set to `true` to explicitly disable WAL (dev/testing only). Events will be buffered in memory only and lost on crash |
| `AKASHI_WAL_SYNC_MODE` | `batch` | Sync mode: `full` (fsync per write, safest), `batch` (periodic fsync, default), `none` (dev only, data loss on crash) |
| `AKASHI_WAL_SYNC_INTERVAL` | `10ms` | How often to fsync in `batch` mode. Lower = safer, higher = faster throughput |
| `AKASHI_WAL_SEGMENT_SIZE` | `67108864` | Max segment file size in bytes before rotation (default 64 MB) |
| `AKASHI_WAL_SEGMENT_RECORDS` | `100000` | Max records per segment before rotation |

When enabled, every event is written to the WAL before being buffered in memory. On startup, un-flushed events are recovered from the WAL and replayed to Postgres via an idempotent insert path. After a successful COPY flush, the WAL checkpoint advances and old segment files are reclaimed. See the architecture overview in `internal/service/trace/wal.go`.

Existing deployments that set `AKASHI_WAL_DIR` explicitly will continue to work unchanged. Deployments that relied on WAL being disabled by default should set `AKASHI_WAL_DISABLE=true` if they want to preserve the old behavior.

## Tuning

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` | `1000` | In-memory event buffer capacity before COPY flush |
| `AKASHI_EVENT_FLUSH_TIMEOUT` | `100ms` | Max time between buffer flushes |
| `AKASHI_INTEGRITY_PROOF_INTERVAL` | `5m` | How often Merkle tree proofs are built for new decisions |
| `AKASHI_ENABLE_DESTRUCTIVE_DELETE` | `false` | Enables irreversible `DELETE /v1/agents/{agent_id}`. Keep `false` in production unless explicitly needed for GDPR workflows |
| `AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | HTTP shutdown grace timeout (`0` = wait indefinitely) |
| `AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_BUFFER_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Maximum time to flush in-memory events to Postgres during shutdown. `0` = wait indefinitely (default, durability-first). Non-zero values bound the drain but risk losing unflushed events — process exits non-zero if events remain. |
| `AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_OUTBOX_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Outbox drain timeout (`0` = wait indefinitely) |
| `AKASHI_PERCENTILE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `1h` | How often to refresh per-org signal percentile caches used for distribution-aware ReScore normalization. Set to `0` to disable |

## Write Idempotency

For retry-safe write APIs (`POST /v1/trace`, `POST /v1/runs`, `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/events`), clients can send:

- `Idempotency-Key: <unique-key>`

Behavior:

- Same key + same payload => server replays the original success response (no duplicate write).
- Same key + different payload => `409 CONFLICT`.
- Same key while the first request is still processing => `409 CONFLICT` (retry later).

Scope and matching rules:

- Keys are scoped by `(org_id, agent_id, endpoint, idempotency_key)`.
- For run events, `endpoint` includes the concrete run ID (for example `POST:/v1/runs/<run_id>/events`).
- Payload matching uses a server-side SHA-256 hash of the canonical JSON payload:
  - `POST /v1/trace`: request body plus header-derived context that changes write semantics.
  - `POST /v1/runs`: request body.
  - `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/events`: request body only.
- Replayed responses preserve the original HTTP status code and response body.

Client guidance:

- Use a UUIDv4 (or similarly random) key per logical write attempt.
- Retry transient network failures with the same key and same payload.
- On `409` with "already in progress", back off and retry.
- Never reuse a key for a different payload.

Operational idempotency settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_IDEMPOTENCY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | `1h` | Background cleanup cadence for idempotency records |
| `AKASHI_IDEMPOTENCY_COMPLETED_TTL` | `168h` (7d) | Retention for completed idempotency records |
| `AKASHI_IDEMPOTENCY_ABANDONED_TTL` | `24h` | Retention for abandoned in-progress idempotency records |

## IDE Hook Endpoints

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_HOOKS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable `/hooks/*` IDE integration endpoints for Claude Code and Cursor. When disabled, the routes are not registered |
| `AKASHI_HOOKS_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Optional API key for non-localhost hook access. When set, remote clients can authenticate with `X-Akashi-Hook-Key` header. Empty = localhost-only (recommended for local dev) |
| `AKASHI_AUTO_TRACE` | `true` | Automatically trace git commits detected in `PostToolUse` hooks as decisions with `confidence: 0.7`. Set to `false` to disable auto-tracing |

Hook endpoints (`/hooks/session-start`, `/hooks/pre-tool-use`, `/hooks/post-tool-use`) are unauthenticated but restricted to localhost by default. They enable IDE agents to receive context injection, edit gating, and automatic decision tracing without shell-script marker files.

## Data retention

Akashi supports per-org data retention policies that automatically delete decisions older than a configured threshold. Policies are set via `PUT /v1/retention` (admin-only). Legal holds (`POST /v1/retention/hold`) exempt matching decisions from both automated and GDPR deletion. All deletion operations are recorded in the `deletion_log` table.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_RETENTION_INTERVAL` | `24h` | How often the background retention worker runs. Set to `0` to disable. |

## Claim embedding retry

When claim embedding generation fails during tracing (network issues, provider downtime), Akashi records the failure and retries with exponential backoff (5min, 20min, capped at 3 attempts). Successful retries automatically trigger conflict scoring.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_CLAIM_RETRY_INTERVAL` | `2m` | How often the background claim embedding retry loop runs. Set to `0` to disable. |
