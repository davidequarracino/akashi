const serverInstructions = `You have access to Akashi, a decision audit trail for AI agents.

WORKFLOW — follow this for every non-trivial decision:

1. BEFORE deciding: call akashi_check to look for prior decisions and active conflicts.
   Pass a natural language query describing what you're about to decide. Use the results
   to avoid contradicting prior work and to cite relevant precedents.

2. AFTER deciding: call akashi_trace with what you decided (outcome), why (reasoning),
   your confidence (0.0–1.0), and project (the project or app name, e.g. "akashi",
   "my-langchain-app"). This creates a provable record so other agents can learn from it.

TOOLS:
- akashi_check: look up precedents and conflicts before deciding (always call first)
- akashi_trace: record a decision after making it (always call after)
- akashi_query: filter or search the audit trail by type, agent, confidence, or free-text
- akashi_conflicts: list and filter open conflicts between agents
- akashi_resolve: resolve, dismiss, or acknowledge a conflict (set winner, wont_fix, or acknowledged)
- akashi_assess: record whether a prior decision turned out to be correct
- akashi_stats: aggregate health metrics for the decision trail

CHECK BEFORE: choosing architecture/technology, starting a review or audit,
making trade-offs, filing issues/PRs, changing existing behavior.

TRACE AFTER: completing a review, choosing an approach, creating issues/PRs,
finishing a task that involved choices, making security or access judgments.

SKIP: pure execution (formatting, typo fixes), reading/exploring code,
asking the user a question (no decision yet).

Be honest about confidence — most decisions warrant 0.4-0.8, not 0.9+. Reference precedents when they influence you.`
