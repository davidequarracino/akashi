			mcplib.WithDescription(`Check the black box for decision precedents before making a new one.

WHEN TO USE: BEFORE making any decision. This is the most important tool —
it prevents contradictions and lets you build on prior work.

Call this FIRST. Pass a natural language query describing what you're about
to decide, and optionally narrow by decision_type. If the audit trail shows
precedents, factor them into your reasoning. If conflicts exist, resolve them.

WHAT YOU GET BACK:
- has_precedent: whether any relevant prior decisions exist
- decisions: the most relevant prior decisions (up to limit)
- conflicts: any active conflicts in this decision area
- prior_resolutions: resolved conflicts for this decision type that had a
  declared winner. Each entry shows winning_outcome (the approach that
  prevailed), winning_agent, losing_outcome (the approach that was rejected),
  and winning_decision_id. Use winning_decision_id as precedent_ref in
  akashi_trace to build explicitly on the validated approach. This is the
  mechanism that prevents agents from resurrecting losing approaches after
  a conflict has been formally resolved.
- precedent_ref_hint: UUID to copy into akashi_trace's precedent_ref field

decision_type is optional. When omitted the search spans all types —
useful when you're not sure how past decisions were categorized.
prior_resolutions are only returned when decision_type is specified.

EXAMPLE: Before choosing a caching strategy, call akashi_check with
query="caching strategy for session data" to find relevant precedents
regardless of whether they were tagged "architecture" or "trade_off".`),

IMPORTANT: Call akashi_check FIRST to look for existing precedents before

and duplicating work that was already done.

WHEN TO USE: After you make any non-trivial decision — choosing a model,
selecting an approach, picking a data source, resolving an ambiguity,
or committing to a course of action.

TWO REQUIRED FIELDS — everything else is optional:
- decision_type: A short category (see enum for standard types)
- outcome: What you decided, stated as a fact ("chose gpt-4o for summarization")

OPTIONAL FIELDS (each improves completeness score and future usefulness):
- confidence: How certain you are (0.0-1.0). Use this calibration guide:
    0.3-0.4 = educated guess, limited information, could easily be wrong
    0.5-0.6 = reasonable choice but real uncertainty remains
    0.7      = solid decision with good supporting evidence
    0.8      = strong conviction, have considered alternatives carefully
    0.9+     = near-certain, would be surprised if this is wrong
  Most decisions should land between 0.4 and 0.8. If you find yourself
  always above 0.8, you are probably not being honest about uncertainty.
- reasoning: Your chain of thought. Why this choice over alternatives?
  More detail = higher completeness score. Aim for >100 characters.
- alternatives: JSON array of options you considered and rejected.
  Format: [{"label":"option description","rejection_reason":"why not chosen"}]
  Include 2-3 alternatives with substantive rejection reasons (>20 chars each).
  This is the single biggest driver of completeness after reasoning.
- evidence: JSON array of supporting facts.
  Format: [{"source_type":"tool_output","content":"test suite passed with 0 failures"},
           {"source_type":"document","content":"ADR-007 requires event sourcing","source_uri":"adrs/007.md"}]
  source_type values: document, api_response, agent_output, user_input, search_result,
                      tool_output, memory, database_query
  Include at least 2 pieces of evidence to maximize completeness.
- project: The project or app this belongs to (e.g. "akashi", "my-langchain-app").
  Enables project-scoped queries. Auto-detected from working directory if omitted.
- precedent_ref: Copy the value of precedent_ref_hint from akashi_check's response.
  Wires the attribution graph so the audit trail shows how decisions evolved.

EXAMPLE: After choosing a caching strategy, record decision_type="architecture",
outcome="chose Redis with 5min TTL for session cache", confidence=0.7,
reasoning="Redis handles our expected QPS, TTL prevents stale reads. Memcached lacks native clustering in our stack. In-memory cache won't share across instances.",
project="my-service",
precedent_ref="<paste precedent_ref_hint from akashi_check here, if applicable>",
alternatives='[{"label":"in-memory cache","rejection_reason":"not shared across instances, would require sticky sessions"},{"label":"Memcached","rejection_reason":"no native clustering in our stack, adds operational overhead"}]',
evidence='[{"source_type":"tool_output","content":"load test showed 8k req/s with Redis, 2k with DB"},{"source_type":"document","content":"ADR-003 mandates shared-nothing architecture"}]'
