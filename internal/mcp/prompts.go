## The Pattern: Check Before, Record After

Every non-trivial decision should follow this workflow:

### Before deciding:
Call akashi_check with the decision_type you're about to make.
This checks the audit trail for existing precedents and any conflicts.
Use this information to make a more informed decision and avoid
contradicting prior work.

### After deciding:
Call akashi_trace to record what you decided, why, and how confident you are.
This adds to the audit trail so other agents (and your future self)
can learn from it, and so the decision is provable later.

## Available Tools

- akashi_check: Check the audit trail for precedents before deciding (use FIRST; pass query for semantic search)
- akashi_trace: Record a decision to the audit trail (use AFTER deciding)
- akashi_query: Query the audit trail — structured filters or natural-language query for semantic search
- akashi_conflicts: List open conflicts between agents
- akashi_assess: Record whether a past decision turned out to be correct
- akashi_stats: Aggregate health metrics for the decision trail

## Decision Types

Any string is accepted. Common categories (these get a small quality score bonus):
- architecture: System design, patterns, infrastructure choices
- security: Authentication, authorization, encryption choices
- code_review: Codebase reviews, audits, quality assessments
- investigation: Debugging, root cause analysis, exploring unknowns
- planning: Task planning, sprint planning, roadmap decisions
- assessment: Risk assessments, evaluations, fitness judgments
- trade_off: Explicit trade-off resolutions (speed vs accuracy, etc.)
- feature_scope: What to include/exclude, prioritization
- deployment: Deployment strategy, environments, rollout plans
- error_handling: How to handle failures, retries, fallbacks
- model_selection: Choosing AI models, parameters, or configurations
- data_source: Where to get data, which datasets, data formats

Use whatever string best describes your decision. Semantic search finds
decisions by meaning, not by exact type match.

## Confidence Levels

Be honest about your confidence:
- 0.9-1.0: Near-certain, strong evidence, well-established pattern
- 0.7-0.8: Confident, good reasoning, some uncertainty remains
- 0.5-0.6: Moderate, reasonable choice but alternatives are viable
- 0.3-0.4: Low confidence, making a judgment call with limited info
- 0.1-0.2: Best guess, would welcome revision with more data`,
