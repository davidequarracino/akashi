// ReScore adjusts raw similarity scores with outcome signals and recency weighting,

//
// Formula (issue #235 redesign):
//
//	outcome_weight =
//	    0.40 * assessment_score    // (correct + 0.5*partial) / total; ONLY when assessed
//	    0.25 * citation_score      // log1p(citations) / log(6); logarithmic, saturates at 5
//	    0.15 * stability_score     // 1.0 unless superseded within 48h (0.0)
//	    0.10 * agreement_score     // min(AgreementCount / 3.0, 1.0)
//	    0.10 * conflict_win_rate   // wins/(wins+losses); ONLY when conflict history exists
//
//	relevance = similarity * (0.5 + 0.5*outcome_weight) * recency_decay
//
// Key design choices vs prior formula:
//   - Assessment is the primary signal (0.40) because it's the only explicit correctness feedback.
//     It contributes 0 when no assessments exist — no phantom neutral score.
//   - Citations use a logarithmic cap so the first citation is worth more than later ones.
//   - Conflict win rate contributes 0 when no conflict history exists, separating "never contested"
//     from "won all conflicts". A decision that lost all conflicts scores 0 on this signal, same as
//     one that was never contested — neither is penalized for the absence of conflict history.
//   - Completeness is removed from the relevance formula. Field-filling quality (evidence,
//     alternatives, reasoning present) does not imply decision correctness. Completeness remains
//     as a display metric but no longer inflates ranking.
//
// Cold-start (new decision, stable, no other signals): outcome_weight = 0.15, multiplier = 0.575.
// Maximum (all signals perfect): outcome_weight = 1.0, multiplier = 1.0 (capped to 1.0 by caller).
// The caller is responsible for populating outcome signal fields on model.Decision before calling
// (see hydrateAndReScore which calls GetDecisionOutcomeSignalsBatch and GetAssessmentSummaryBatch).
