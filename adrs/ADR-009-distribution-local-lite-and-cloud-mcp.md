# ADR-009: Distribution tiers — local-lite and cloud-hosted MCP

**Status:** Accepted — local-lite tier not yet implemented (issue #312)
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Amends:** ADR-004 (MCP and framework integrations as primary distribution channels)

## Context

ADR-004 described MCP as "one line of config." In practice the self-hosted setup requires Docker Compose, TimescaleDB, Qdrant, and Ollama. First launch takes 15–25 minutes as Ollama pulls a 670 MB embedding model and a 6.6 GB LLM. That is not one line of config — it is a meaningful infrastructure commitment before a user has had any opportunity to evaluate whether the check-before/trace-after workflow is useful to them.

The most-used MCP tools share a property: they work in under 60 seconds with zero infrastructure. Akashi cannot compete on that axis with full self-hosted as the only entry point.

Two concrete gaps compound the problem:

**Gap 1 — No zero-infra local path.** There is no way to use Akashi without running a database. The full stack is the only OSS option.

**Gap 2 — JWT auth in MCP config files.** JWTs expire in 24h and are invalidated on server restart (with the default ephemeral signing key). `ApiKey` credentials (non-expiring, wired in the middleware since the spec 37 security hardening) were never documented for MCP use. Users who followed the README were putting credentials in their MCP config that would silently break overnight.

## Decision

### Two new distribution tiers (amending ADR-004)

| Layer | Target | Integration effort | Status |
|-------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| **Local-lite** (`npx @akashi/local`) | Individuals evaluating the workflow | Zero config — no server, no auth | Planned (#312) |
| MCP server (self-hosted) | Teams running their own infra | Docker Compose + API key | Shipped |
| **Cloud-hosted MCP** | Teams without infra | One API key | Planned (#313, #314) |
| Framework integrations | Agent builders | One import + decorator | Shipped |
| SDKs (Go, Python, TypeScript) | Programmatic integrators | Import, instantiate, call | Shipped |
| HTTP API | Everything else | Raw HTTP | Shipped |

### Local-lite

A self-contained binary published to npm as `@akashi/local`. Writes to SQLite at `~/.akashi/akashi.db`. No Docker, no Postgres, no Qdrant, no Ollama. Starts in under 3 seconds.

MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "akashi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@akashi/local"]
    }
  }
}
```

No URL, no token, no auth. Same trust model as other local MCP servers.

**Included in local-lite:**
- All 6 MCP tools with identical signatures to the full server
- SQLite storage — decisions, events, assessments, basic conflicts
- Text search via SQLite FTS5 (always available, zero config)
- Semantic search via brute-force cosine similarity (available when an embedding provider is configured)

**Excluded from local-lite:**
- LLM conflict validation
- Conflict groups
- Multi-tenancy
- SSE / real-time notifications
- Audit dashboard

The tools are complete and useful without semantics. The workflow — check before deciding, trace after deciding — is identical; the intelligence degrades gracefully based on what's configured.

### Search design

`akashi_check` needs to return relevant prior decisions. Local-lite supports two modes depending on whether an embedding provider is available:

**Text search (default, zero config):** SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking. Finds decisions that share vocabulary with the query. Works immediately, no API keys, no running services. Misses semantic matches (a query for "caching strategy" won't find a decision about "Redis TTL configuration" unless those words appear), but is sufficient for the evaluation use case.

**Semantic search (when an embedding provider is configured):** Uses the same embedding provider chain as the full server — Ollama if `AKASHI_OLLAMA_URL` is set, OpenAI if `AKASHI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise falls back to text. Embeddings are stored as BLOBs in SQLite. At query time, all vectors are loaded into memory and ranked by cosine similarity in Go.

The brute-force in-memory approach was chosen over embedded vector libraries (FAISS, sqlite-vec) deliberately:

- **Scale is not the problem local-lite is solving.** A single user accumulating enough decisions for brute-force cosine similarity to become slow (roughly 50k+ vectors) is long past the point where they should be on the full stack or cloud. Optimizing for that case would be optimizing for users who have outgrown the tool.
- **FAISS** has no well-maintained Go bindings and stores its index as a separate file, breaking the single-file SQLite model.
- **sqlite-vec** requires CGO and a SQLite extension, adding build complexity for a problem that doesn't exist at local-lite scale.
- **Brute force in Go** requires no CGO, no extensions, no dependencies, and no separate index file. At <10k decisions it runs in single-digit milliseconds.

If evidence emerges that local-lite users are hitting scale limits on search, the brute-force implementation can be replaced with sqlite-vec without changing the storage interface or the MCP tool handlers. That replacement is a follow-up, not a prerequisite.

**Architecture constraints:**
- New `storage/sqlite` package implementing the same storage interface as the Postgres backend. SQLite schema is created on first run; no Atlas migrations.
- New `cmd/akashi-local` binary wired to the existing MCP server with stdio transport (no HTTP, no port).
- npm wrapper using `optionalDependencies` per OS/arch (same pattern as esbuild). Targets: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-amd64`. Windows is out of scope for the initial release.
- `cmd/akashi-local` must not import Postgres, Qdrant, or Ollama packages. This is a hard dependency boundary enforced at compile time. Any capability added to the MCP tools must have a functional fallback for local-lite or must be gated behind feature detection.
- No changes to the MCP tool handlers — local-lite plugs in at the storage layer only.

**Upgrade path:** Users who need LLM-validated conflict detection, conflict groups, or multi-agent sharing switch to the cloud tier (change `command` config to a URL + API key). Local-lite data does not migrate automatically; that is a follow-up.

### Cloud-hosted MCP

A hosted endpoint where the complete setup is one API key in the MCP config. No Docker, no database, no JWT renewal. Implementation is infrastructure work outside this repo; the OSS server changes required are:

1. `GET /mcp/info` (unauthenticated) — returns server version, transport, and supported auth schemes. **Shipped in PR #315.**
2. `POST /auth/signup` — creates org, agent, and managed `ak_`-format API key atomically. Returns a ready-to-paste MCP config snippet. Tracked in issue #314.

### `ApiKey` as the canonical MCP auth scheme

`ApiKey <agent_id>:<key>` is the correct credential for MCP config files. It does not expire and survives server restarts. `Bearer <jwt>` remains supported but is appropriate for programmatic use, not persistent config.

The README MCP section now leads with `ApiKey`. **Shipped in PR #315.** For self-hosted deployments, `ApiKey admin:<AKASHI_ADMIN_API_KEY>` works directly against the legacy key path — no managed key creation needed.

## Consequences

- ADR-004's "one line of config" claim is corrected: it is accurate for local-lite and cloud-hosted; self-hosted is "Docker Compose + API key."
- `cmd/akashi-local` is a new binary target in this repo. It must stay dependency-clean — no Postgres, Qdrant, or Ollama imports.
- The SQLite storage interface must stay in sync with the Postgres storage interface. Any new storage method needed by an MCP tool must be implemented in both backends, or the tool must degrade gracefully when the method is unavailable.
- Local-lite and self-hosted are the evaluation and team funnel respectively. Cloud is the conversion target.
- ADRs in this repo have their own numbering sequence starting from ADR-001. Next ADR: ADR-010.
